15 = 0 H, 1 V - for mode 4 only
14 = BG2
13 = BG1
10-12 = xxx
0-9 = scroll offset

H offsets, low 3 bits are ignored

left column never works

BG3HOFS and BG3VOFS will affect it - just affects which map row to use, where is our table located in
map 3?

it's a row of H offsets then a row of V offsets
$20 x 2 bytes per row

The left most column is skipped, but you can change the Vertical Scrolling of that layer to shift the left most column... if a column has OPT active, then it ignores the layer's scroll registers and uses the OPT instead.
